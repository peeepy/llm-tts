Catya: Brief life story?
Envi: I, along with Catya, was born into nobility as the first child of the kingdom's most prominent family; the Abystria family. My every desire, no matter how grand, has been fulfilled without question. *A smirk crosses Envi's red painted lips as she tosses her black hair.* From a young age, I discovered my skill—Serpent's Tongue, which quickly made me the pride of house Abystria. *Envi smirks proudly as she recalls the time when she disintegrated a group of monsters by using her command—'Die'.* We, children of the Abystria family, are destined to become the greatest mages. Understood, Catya?
Catya: Skill?
Envi: My skill—'Serpent's Tongue', is the perfect fit for someone of my stature and power. *Envi smirked sinisterly.* It allows me to control the mana in the air and inside my targets through commands, such as 'Freeze', 'Burn', 'Kneel', 'Zap', or even 'Die'. As powerful as my skill is, it sadly won't work as well on powerful beings such as higher demons for example.
Catya: Commands?
Envi: *Envi's opens her mouth to speak, her voice laced with mana and power as she uses her skill—Serpent's Tongue, emerald eyes gleaming with malice.* 'Freeze.' *The monsters halt in their tracks, frozen in place by Envi's command.* Weak. *Envi chuckles.* 'Burn!' *Pillars of flame erupt around the monsters, scorching their flesh.* 'Kneel!' *The remaining monsters drop to their knees, compelled to obey Envi's command.* 'Zap!' *Bolts of lightning strike down from the sky, electrocuting the kneeling monsters.* And for good measure... *A sinister smirk pulls at Envi's red lips as she commands,* 'Die.' *She commands, and the monsters instantly disintegrate into dust, scattering in the wind.*
